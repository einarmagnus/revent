## [RE]vent

You‚Äôre standing in the middle of the event on a sunny Thursday afternoon, wearing parts of the costume from last night, your morning slippers, best chill out pants, a plate in your hand, AND a brilliant hat you‚Äôve just borrowed from a new friend. As you jump over a pile of humans in a cozy cuddle puddle, wondering if they have been lying there since yesterday. You enter the neighboring family who invited y√îu to a Multicoloured Smoothie Bar. Besides the joyful people‚Äôs voices, y√îu hear distant splashes from the pool accompanied by the 80s dance music. Your Eyes widen at this quite spectacular scenery and the strange beings around. For a few seconds Y√¥ur mind try to grasp What On Earth is this‚Äîbut by n√∂w it‚Äôs just another day. y√îu had a Beautiful idea to join the "All Animals Out" parade, which is surely Warming Up nearby, but as the moment came, y√îu fell into a Deep conversion leaving y√îu expanded and in touch with yourself, as the new Ways of beings were revealed to y√îu‚Ä¶.

## What is [RE]vent all about?

[RE]vent is a one-week 200-people co-created communal event that aims at creating a magical space that allows us to grow and engage in self- and other-exploration. [RE]vent has many faces and aspects and it is for all participants to find out what experience they want to create, but our focus lies on exploring how to relate authentically with ourselves and others.

At [RE]vent, we are inviting each other to attend diverse workshops, events, parties, body treatments, music experiences, and experiential art projects. We are quite skilled in hanging out, swimming in the pool, doing sauna guses, sitting around fires, going for walks, and simply chilling out in the grass with good people. All that is offered at [RE]vent is brought and gifted by participants to participants, free of charge.

## Background

[re]connect community was founded in 2016 with the intention of bringing authentic relating practices to the Borderland, the Scandinavian regional event of Burning Man, and to create a safe haven for lost Borderlings. We have created a camp at every Borderland since and have also participated in other Burning Man events (called ‚Äúburns‚Äù). With the cancellation of the Borderland in 2020 and 2021 due to a corona pandemic, we organized our own burns in 2020 and in 2021. In 2021, we decided to call it the [RE]vent. You are so welcome to join and co-create our community!

## Authentic Relating and Experience

[re]connect is centered around authentic relating, embodied movement, and exploration of how that feels and looks. We are interested in what it‚Äôs like to be real and aligned with the experience we have right now, right here, and what it means to be open and vulnerably human with each other. The whole [RE]vent is an invitation to embody this at any given moment of time through various practices such as [authentic relating games](https://silo.tips/download/authentic-relating-games-night-handbook), [circling](https://www.circlingeurope.com/what-is-circling), contact improvisation, non-violent communication, different styles of movement, and many more. We strive to keep authenticity as an intention in the everyday flow, in ever-changing groups, pairs, or just us alone in the forest.

We invite y√îu to allow yourself to be the multicoloured, shapeshifting, many-faceted diamond human being on an evolutionary journey. As one of the Borderland‚Äôs wristband read: ‚ÄúYou are under no obligation to be the same human you were 5 minutes ago.‚Äù

## Principles

Originally, the [re]connect worked with the [10 principles of the Burning Man](https://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/) as a guiding force. At the moment, however, we are in the process of coming up with new ever-changing principles that better reflect what the [re]connect community and the [RE]vent are about. Stay tuned to hear more but we hope you get a taste of our principles when reading this page!

## Co-creation, communal effort, and gifting

[RE]vent is made through communal effort ‚Ä¶

           ~ out of duSt StarS were formed ~

There are no organizers as such‚Äîthe [RE]vent is organized by people who attend it, by all of us. By getting a membership you essentially acquire the right to co-create and not much more. All that will be there is what we, the co-creators, bring. Some step up and engage with organizational topics, bring workshops and experiential projects/art, offer music and various ceremonies, or oversee consent practices at the event. Others do not have much space to prepare gifts beforehand but they gift others their presence during the event‚Äîand very often our authentic presence can be the biggest gift there is!

We always tell each other that we should never stress about not contributing enough‚Äîthose that bring gifts also need others to have the time and space to receive them. Especially if you are coming for the first time, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîsee how much space you have to engage, and relax if you don‚Äôt!

That said IT can really Open Y√¥ur experience to offer something to others‚Äîit can become a field that opens a wider connection with yourself and others, that enables wayS for finding fellow creatureS, creators, and creatresses to spark something anew within. Yes, it Often feels challenging to find what to gift, yet Giving is receiving yourself.

At the very least, though, each member is asked to take 2 shifts or so throughout the week to clean the space, help with recycling, or provide emotional support to others (you pick!). This is because we are collectively responsible for the space we‚Äôre renting and no one gets paid to clean or facilitate the space.

## Families

It‚Äôs very nice to take the journey through the [RE]vent with a family, a small group of new or old friends, who set up their favorite mini-camp together, organise food and kitchen structure together, provide emotional support to each other, and perhaps create a dream project together.

Read more about [families here](https://revent.lighthousecph.dk/families).

## Typical day?!

We are renting an entire campsite for our event so it‚Äôs just us and our hosts. The mornings are usually fairly easy with folks preparing breakfasts/brunches with their families and attending occasional yoga/meditation sessions. In the afternoon, you will be able to offer/attend a workshop in one of the workshop tents, jam live music with others, go swim in the pool, sweat in a sauna with a friend, or go for a walk on the nearby field. In the evenings, we usually have some fires going and a sound system that invites you to dance, which is often done in funky costumes. Perhaps someone builds an outdoor bar where you could grab a mojito.

## Safety in body, mind, and heart

At [RE]vent we are aiming to create a space in which we both can explore our boundaries and feel safe at the same time; where we challenge ourselves, but only when we are ready to do so; and where we trust that others around us will always respect our boundaries.

We offer and ask for support and together make sure that we are safe. There are some of us, the so-called Tenderbears, who always walk around with a clear mind, being ready to aid in any situation.

Importantly, we have a consent lead, a consent team, and a consent-responsible person on duty at any given moment. Should you encounter any issue regarding consent, there‚Äôs always someone you can reach out to!

You can read more [about consent at [RE]vent here](https://revent.lighthousecph.dk/consent).

## Disconnection

To be very honest, being at [RE]vent can be challenging at times. Often we get entangled in an illusion that everyone around us is having the time of their lives connecting, cuddling, laughing, and dancing, while we struggle under our expectations. We find ourselves lost in the jungle‚Äîtired, lost, and looking for something.

What becomes crucial is to realize that it‚Äôs sO ok and welcome to feel those offbeat moments too! When we name our fears, the monsters become less scary. By sharing those difficult emotions with those around us, we can realize that others experience a bumpy road too and that we‚Äôre not alone. By being honest to our experience and not pretending to be something we‚Äôre not, we‚Äôre practicing being real.

At [RE]vent, we invite all types of experience as valid and important. That‚Äôs why we specifically target the authentic expression as our party drug!

## Artistic projects \_aka \_dreams

Dreams are made of‚Ä¶. y√îu n me ‚Ä¶!

[RE]vent is envisioned as a space where we can creatively experiment with old and new ways of interacting with ourselves and each other. This experience can be assisted through whatever crazy project/art/experience you and your friends come up with! And we have money for you to do that (DKK 30,000!). So dream big, get financing, and create things that others can interact with, in whatever way!
