Dreaming is a central part of a burn; a burn starts in someoneâ€™s dream and is created in the dreams of leads, of the crazy ones with big aspirations, of the foresighted who make dreams and realities meet, of us all.

Dreaming is a process that once it is started and shared with others inspires for more and more dreaming and gains momentum. A digital dream platform forms the space where we can share our wildest dreams about this burn with others, maybe someone had a similar dream or wants to join forces with us to create this dream; where we can ask for this one unique thingy that you need for your dream that someone might happen to have in their basement, or apply for a share of the dream grant of up to 30.000 DKK to cover material costs.

There we can also get all excited by looking through what others dream about and show them our approval to make sure they get the funds they asked for. Dreams can be about building or creating a space at the location, holding an event, shaping our collective culture through proposing small acts and many more things.
