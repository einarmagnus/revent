Since REvent is built around Relations and creating a space for exploring the relations to yourself and others, minding the consent is crucial in forming that space. Consent is essential in both physical and emotional meetings. At REconnect we have introduced a consent-council that both hosts workshops during the festival and to whom you can turn for guidance, advice and support if needed.

<!-- You can contact the consent-council HERE -->

## Asking for consent

Asking for consent is key. So how do you do that? Requests and invitations will be your best friends here
“Can I hug you” “would you like a hug”

## Make your consent clear to others

Staying in touch with your YES and NO is important. When you are sure about your own consent, don’t assume other people can read your mind, but express your position, intention or need clearly.

## Changing your consent

Consent can be changed at any time. If you feel that your YES is turning into a NO, then say “I have changed my mind and I will not participate anymore”.
If you feel that your NO is turning into a YES then say “I have changed my mind and I would love to participate”.

## Asking about consent

Ask explicitly about consent. Asking is key to creating a consent-based space. Asking for consent is inclusion. Someone who might have been unsure if they were allowed to participate, gets a clear signal that they are invited. Someone who might have been unsure if they really wanted to participate, gets a clear signal that they should take responsibility for their own actions.

## When you get an answer

If you ask for consent and get a YES, you can answer with a “Thank you”. If you ask for consent and get a NO, also answer with a “Thank you”. In any case, show appreciation of the other person connecting with their YES or NO.

If you’re ever in doubt if there is consent from all participants, you should assume there isn’t. If you ask, and can’t get a clear answer, you should assume there isn’t.

## Taking your responsibility

The participants are always responsible for giving their own consent, changing their own consent and asking others for consent. Whenever consent is unclear, everyone involved has the same responsibility to make consent clear and outspoken. When consent becomes unclear, you have the responsibility to pause your participation and communicate that you feel consent is unclear, no matter if you feel it is unclear within yourself or in others.

## Documentation

Reconnect should be a free space for anyone. Stay in the moment as much as possible, experiencing the moment in the now rather than being there in order to document it for later. Making sure no pictures are taken without consent, will open up our minds to be free to act out our inner, impulsive, experimental and desired self.
